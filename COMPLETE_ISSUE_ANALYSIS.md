# Complete Issue Analysis - Tool Call Failure

## What You Observed

### 1. LLM Output in Chat
```
Modern web architecture is a blueprint...

[explanation text]

createDocument(kind='text', content='''
graph TD
    A[Client - Browser/Mobile App] -->|Request HTML, CSS, JS, Data| B(Load Balancer)
    ...
''', title='Modern Web Architecture Diagram')
```

### 2. Issues Identified
1. **Tool call syntax visible in chat** - Raw Python-like code shown to user
2. **Wrong parameters** - Model using `content` parameter (doesn't exist)
3. **Correct parameters present** - `kind` and `title` are correct
4. **Document embedded in chat** - Not opening in right-side panel
5. **Tool never executed** - No `[createDocument Tool] EXECUTE CALLED!` in logs

---

## Architecture Understanding

### Current Two-Agent Design

```
User Message
    ↓
Chat Model (Gemini 2.5 Pro - User's API Key)
    ↓
Calls Tool: createDocument(title, kind)
    ↓
Tool Execution:
  - Generates document ID
  - Sends metadata to UI (data-kind, data-id, data-title)
  - Calls Document Handler based on kind
    ↓
Document Handler (e.g., textDocumentHandler)
    ↓
Calls Artifact Model (Test env only - myProvider)
    ↓
Artifact Model generates content:
  - For "text": Generates markdown/Mermaid diagram
  - Streams content back to UI
    ↓
UI displays in right panel
```

### Key Insight: createDocument Does NOT Take Content

Looking at the tool definition:
```typescript
inputSchema: z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  kind: z.enum(artifactKinds),  // "text" | "code" | "spreadsheet"
}),
```

**The tool only needs:**
- `title`: What to create
- `kind`: Type of artifact

**The content is generated BY the Artifact Model AFTER the tool is called**, not passed as a parameter!

### How It Should Work

1. **Chat Model** (Gemini): "User wants a diagram"
2. **Chat Model calls**: `createDocument({ title: "Modern Web Architecture", kind: "text" })`
3. **Tool executes**:
   - Sends metadata to UI
   - Finds `textDocumentHandler`
   - Calls `textDocumentHandler.onCreateDocument({ title, dataStream })`
4. **Text Handler**:
   - Calls **Artifact Model** (separate LLM): `streamText({ prompt: title, ... })`
   - Artifact Model generates the Mermaid diagram
   - Streams to UI via `data-textDelta`
5. **UI** displays in right panel

## Why It's Failing

### Problem 1: Model Confused About Tool Call Format

The Chat Model (Gemini) is generating:
```python
createDocument(kind='text', content='''...''', title='...')
```

**Issues:**
1. **Wrong format**: This is Python syntax, not a tool call
2. **Extra parameter**: `content` doesn't exist in the schema
3. **Misunderstanding architecture**: Model thinks it needs to provide the content

**Why this happens:**
- Model has `code_execution` capability enabled
- Model sees it can run Python code
- Model thinks createDocument is a Python function
- Model tries to generate content itself instead of letting Artifact Model do it

### Problem 2: Tool Call Not Being Invoked

**Evidence:**
- No `[createDocument Tool] EXECUTE CALLED!` in logs
- Raw tool call syntax visible in UI
- No document created

**This means**: The AI SDK is NOT recognizing the model's output as a tool call. It's treating it as regular text.

**Why:**
- Google Gemini models expect tool calls in a specific JSON format
- The AI SDK converts tool definitions to that format
- But if the model generates Python-like syntax, the SDK doesn't recognize it
- So it passes it through as text to the UI

### Problem 3: Architecture Mismatch in Model's Understanding

The system prompt likely tells the model:
- "You can create documents"
- "Use createDocument tool"
- "You can execute code"

The model infers (incorrectly):
- "I should use Python code execution to call createDocument"
- "I need to provide the content as a parameter"
- "I'll write the Mermaid diagram myself"

But the **actual design** is:
- Chat Model calls tool (JSON, not Python)
- Tool is empty shell that triggers Artifact Model
- Artifact Model generates content
- Content streams to UI

---

## Root Cause: Code Execution Capability Conflict

### The Smoking Gun

Your Google Gemini model has:
```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "codeExecution": { "enabled": true },
    "webSearch": { "enabled": true },
    "urlContext": { "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

**The Problem:**
1. Google's `code_execution` tool is in the tools list
2. System prompt says "You can execute Python code"
3. Model sees createDocument and thinks "I'll use Python to call this"
4. Model generates Python syntax: `createDocument(kind='text', content='''...''')`
5. This is NOT a valid tool call format
6. AI SDK treats it as text
7. User sees raw Python code

### Why Model Adds `content` Parameter

The model is trying to be helpful:
- It generates the Mermaid diagram
- It wants to pass it to createDocument
- It adds a `content` parameter (which doesn't exist)

But the **design** is:
- createDocument only receives title + kind
- Artifact Model generates content AFTER tool is called

---

## Verification: What Console Logs Will Show

### If Tool Was Called (Expected - But Not Happening)

```
[Chat API] ✓ Adding createDocument tool
[Chat API] createDocument config: { isEnabled: true, ... }
[createDocument Tool] Initializing with config: { ... }

← User sends message →

[Chat API] Agent config loaded: { enabledTools: ["createDocument", ...], ... }
[Chat API] === FINAL ACTIVE TOOLS ===
[Chat API] Active tool names: ["createDocument", ...]
[Chat API] About to call streamText with: { ... }
[Chat API] streamText call successful

← Model generates tool call →

[createDocument Tool] EXECUTE CALLED! {
  title: "Modern Web Architecture Diagram",
  kind: "text",
  userId: "...",
  timestamp: "..."
}
[createDocument Tool] Generated document ID: xxx
[createDocument Tool] Handler found, calling onCreateDocument...

← Artifact Model generates content →

[createDocument Tool] ✅ Document created successfully
```

### What You're Actually Seeing (Current - Broken)

```
[Chat API] ✓ Adding createDocument tool
[Chat API] createDocument config: { isEnabled: true, ... }
[createDocument Tool] Initializing with config: { ... }

← User sends message →

[Chat API] Agent config loaded: { enabledTools: ["createDocument", ...], ... }
[Chat API] === FINAL ACTIVE TOOLS ===
[Chat API] Active tool names: ["createDocument", ...]
[Chat API] About to call streamText with: { ... }
[Chat API] streamText call successful

← Model generates Python-like syntax instead of tool call →
← AI SDK doesn't recognize it as a tool call →
← Passes through as text to UI →

[No tool execution logs]
```

**UI displays:**
```
createDocument(kind='text', content='''[diagram]''', title='...')
```

## Why Architecture Redesign Is NOT Needed

### Current Architecture Is Correct

The two-agent design makes sense:

1. **Chat Model** (User's API key):
   - Handles conversation
   - Decides WHAT to create
   - Calls createDocument tool with title + kind
   - Cost: User pays

2. **Artifact Model** (Your API key - test only):
   - Generates artifact content
   - Isolated from conversation
   - Focused on content generation
   - Cost: You pay (test env)

**Benefits:**
- Separation of concerns
- User doesn't pay for artifact generation
- Artifact Model can be optimized for content generation
- Chat Model focuses on conversation

### The Problem Is NOT Architecture

The problem is:
- **Tool call format confusion** in Chat Model
- **Multiple capabilities causing conflict** (code execution + tools)
- **System prompt not clear enough** about tool call format

---

## The Real Issues

### Issue #1: Code Execution Conflicts with Tool Calls

**Problem:**
- Google `code_execution` tool is active
- Model thinks it can execute Python
- Model generates Python syntax to call createDocument
- This is NOT a tool call format
- AI SDK doesn't recognize it

**Evidence:**
- `hasExecute: false` for `code_execution` tool in verification
- Model generating Python-like syntax
- Tool execution never triggered

### Issue #2: Tool Schema Mismatch

**What Model Generates:**
```python
createDocument(kind='text', content='...', title='...')
```

**What Schema Expects:**
```typescript
{
  title: string,
  kind: "text" | "code" | "spreadsheet"
}
```

**Missing:** `content` parameter doesn't exist!

**Why:** Model doesn't understand it should only provide title + kind, and let Artifact Model generate content.

### Issue #3: System Prompt Confusion

The combined system prompt has:
1. Agent prompt: "You can create artifacts with createDocument"
2. Model base prompt: "You have code execution capabilities"
3. Tool prompt: "Creates artifacts... use kind='text' for diagrams"

**Result:** Model thinks it should:
- Execute Python code
- Generate content itself
- Pass content to createDocument

**Should be:** Model should:
- Call tool with JSON format
- Only pass title + kind
- Let Artifact Model generate content

## Solutions (In Priority Order)

### Solution 1: Disable Code Execution for Testing ⭐ (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Action:**
1. Admin → Models → Edit Gemini 2.5 Pro
2. Disable:
   - ✗ Code Execution
   - ✗ Web Search (optional, but test without first)
   - ✗ URL Context (optional, but test without first)
3. Keep only custom tools enabled:
   - ✓ createDocument
   - ✓ updateDocument
   - ✓ requestSuggestions
   - ✓ getWeather

**Expected Result:**
- Model won't see `code_execution` tool
- Won't try to use Python syntax
- Should generate proper tool calls
- createDocument should execute

**This will prove:** Code execution is causing the conflict.

### Solution 2: Fix Tool Prompts to Be More Explicit

**Current createDocument description:**
```
Creates artifacts that appear in a dedicated panel. Use for documents, Mermaid diagrams, code, or spreadsheets. When user asks for 'diagram' or 'flowchart', use kind='text' with Mermaid syntax.
```

**Problem:** Doesn't explain that content is auto-generated.

**Better description:**
```
Create an artifact document that will be displayed in a side panel. The content will be automatically generated based on the title you provide.

PARAMETERS:
- title: (string, required) What the document should be about
- kind: (enum, required) Type of artifact:
  - "text": For documents, Mermaid diagrams, flowcharts, markdown content
  - "code": For code examples and implementations
  - "spreadsheet": For data tables and structured data

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT provide content - it will be generated automatically
- For diagrams: Use kind="text" and provide a descriptive title
- Call this tool directly as a tool call, NOT as Python code

EXAMPLES:
- Diagram: { title: "User Authentication Flow", kind: "text" }
- Code: { title: "Binary Search Implementation in Python", kind: "code" }
- Spreadsheet: { title: "Q4 Sales Data", kind: "spreadsheet" }
```

### Solution 3: Update System Prompt to Clarify Tool Call Format

**Add to Model base prompt:**
```
## Tool Call Format

When using tools, call them directly as tool calls in JSON format.
DO NOT use Python code syntax to call tools.
DO NOT use print() or other Python functions around tool calls.

CORRECT:
{
  "name": "createDocument",
  "parameters": {
    "title": "Diagram Title",
    "kind": "text"
  }
}

INCORRECT:
print(createDocument(kind='text', content='...', title='...'))
createDocument(kind='text', content='...')
```

### Solution 4: Check Provider Tool Structure

**Problem:** Provider tools showing `hasExecute: false`

**Action:**
```typescript
// In tool-builder.ts, add validation
if (capabilities.codeExecution?.enabled) {
  if (provider === "google") {
    const tool = providerInstance.tools.codeExecution({});
    console.log("[Tool Builder] Google code execution tool structure:", Object.keys(tool));
    tools.code_execution = tool;
  }
}
```

**This will show:** If Google SDK tools are structured differently.

### Solution 5: Add Tool Call Interceptor (Advanced)

**Add after streamText call:**
```typescript
result.onStepFinish((step) => {
  console.log("[Chat API] Step finished:", {
    type: step.type,
    toolCallsCount: step.toolCalls?.length || 0,
    toolNames: step.toolCalls?.map(tc => tc.toolName),
    toolResults: step.toolResults?.map(tr => ({ name: tr.toolName, success: !tr.error })),
  });

  // Log each tool call details
  step.toolCalls?.forEach((toolCall, index) => {
    console.log(`[Chat API] Tool Call ${index + 1}:`, {
      name: toolCall.toolName,
      args: toolCall.args,
    });
  });
});
```

**This will show:** If tool calls are being generated at all.

## Next Steps (Recommended Order)

### Step 1: Disable Code Execution (5 minutes)

1. Go to Admin Panel → Models Tab
2. Edit "Gemini 2.5 Pro"
3. Scroll to Capabilities
4. Toggle OFF:
   - Code Execution
   - Web Search (optional)
   - URL Context (optional)
5. Save
6. Test: "create a simple flowchart"
7. Check logs for `[createDocument Tool] EXECUTE CALLED!`

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Tool call works
- ✅ Document opens in right panel
- ✅ No Python syntax in output

**If this works:** Code execution was the culprit. Keep it disabled.

### Step 2: Update Tool Descriptions (10 minutes)

1. Go to Admin Panel → Tools Tab
2. Edit "Create Document"
3. Update prompts (see Solution 2 above)
4. Save
5. Test again

**Expected Outcome:**
- Better tool call accuracy
- Model understands it shouldn't provide content

### Step 3: Check Console Logs (5 minutes)

Run the app and check for:
1. Tool loading
2. Agent configuration
3. Final active tools
4. Tool verification (with `actualKeys`)
5. Tool execution

**Share these logs** if issue persists.

### Step 4: Test with Simple Request (2 minutes)

Don't ask for complex diagrams initially. Test with:
- "Create a simple document about AI"
- "Create a basic flowchart with 3 steps"
- "Create a hello world code example"

**This isolates:** Whether issue is with all createDocument calls or just complex ones.

### Step 5: Check myProvider Configuration (5 minutes)

**Verify Artifact Model is configured:**
```typescript
// In lib/ai/providers.ts
console.log("[Providers] myProvider status:", {
  exists: !!myProvider,
  hasLanguageModel: !!myProvider?.languageModel,
});
```

**Check in console:** When app starts, should see myProvider logging.

## Questions to Answer

### Q1: Does the tool call execute AT ALL?

**Check logs for:**
```
[createDocument Tool] EXECUTE CALLED!
```

**If YES:** Problem is in tool execution
**If NO:** Problem is in tool call generation (model output format)

### Q2: What does the model actually generate?

**In UI, model shows:**
```
createDocument(kind='text', content='''...''', title='...')
```

**This is Python syntax, NOT a tool call.**

**Correct tool call should be invisible to user** - only result should show.

### Q3: Are provider tools causing interference?

**Check logs:**
```
[Chat API] Tool "code_execution": {
  exists: true,
  hasDescription: false,
  hasExecute: false
}
```

**If hasExecute: false:** Provider tool is malformed or incompatible.

### Q4: Is the issue specific to Google Gemini?

**Test with different model:**
1. Select Claude 3.5 Sonnet (if you have Anthropic key)
2. Try same request
3. See if createDocument works

**If works with Claude:** Google-specific tool call format issue.

---

## Summary

### The Core Problem

**The Chat Model is generating Python code syntax instead of proper tool calls**, causing:
1. AI SDK doesn't recognize it as a tool call
2. Tool never executes
3. Raw syntax shown to user
4. No artifact created

### Root Cause

**Code Execution capability enabled + Tool calling = Confusion**

The model sees:
- `code_execution` tool (Python execution)
- `createDocument` tool (artifact creation)

And incorrectly decides:
- "I'll use Python to call createDocument"
- "I'll generate the content myself"
- "I'll pass content as a parameter"

### The Fix

**Disable code execution** (and optionally web search/URL context) to isolate tool calling.

### Architecture Is Fine

The two-agent design (Chat Model → Tool → Artifact Model) is correct and doesn't need redesign. The issue is purely about tool call format confusion in the Chat Model.

### Test Now

1. Disable code execution
2. Test createDocument
3. Check if tool executes
4. Verify document opens in right panel

If this works, we know code execution was the problem and can then figure out how to have BOTH code execution AND tool calls working together (likely requires better prompt engineering or separating capabilities).
